# Twitter Clone

Welcome to my little project where I'm trying to build a Twitter clone just for fun and mostly learning. From development to deployment.

**PS** *(Note to self)*: Another project waiting to be shelved


## Whatâ€™s the Plan?

Watching a bunch of videos and reading up on how to create a social media app (Twitter/X). Literally trying to binge-watch @Unknown Koder's Twitter playlist on YT whilst trying to find references on multiple engineering blogs and good old documentation. Still counts as a plan. Will probably update if I get any better ideas

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Java with Spring Boot
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React + Vite with TypeScript

## What Have I Learned so far?

Better grasp of some new concepts in Spring Security 6.
